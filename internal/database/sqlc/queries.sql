-- SQL queries for bt database operations
-- This file will be populated with queries as we implement database methods
--
-- sqlc will generate type-safe Go code from these queries
-- See: https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/

-- Example query structure (to be implemented):
-- -- name: GetDirectory :one
-- SELECT * FROM directories WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1;
